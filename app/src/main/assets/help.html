<h3 style="text-align: center;">Notice</h3>
All GPS applications on any <b>handheld non-certified devices</b> like
smartphones and tablets are <b><em>not approved by the FAA for IFR</em></b> flights. 
None of the operating systems on such devices are tested according to rigorous 
FAA standards, hence any software running on them is unfit for 
use as a primary flight navigation tool. It is unwise to solely rely 
on any such device or any app running on one, during the critical 
phases of a flight.
<p>
Please do not download any charts/plates that you do not need. Downloading 
only the needed files will help us keep server hosting costs down, which along 
with donations helps us keep Avare and chart updates free to all. Thank you.
</p>
The user must ensure that Avare is always updated to the latest
version, and <b>ensure that all Avare databases and charts are kept current</b>.
If Avare and its databases and charts are not of the exact same
version, the GPS position displayed may be inaccurate, because <b>the FAA
sometimes changes the format</b> of their materials. Avare does not
automatically fetch any databases and charts when they are expired, so
it is the user's sole responsibility to update any expired charts and
databases. To do so, ensure that your device has an internet connection and
then just <b>press the Map, Options, Download and Update buttons</b> in Avare.<br>
